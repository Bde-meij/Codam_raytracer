How to run the project:

(from console in root directory)\
1 "mkdir build" (make a 'build' map in the root directory)\
2 "cd build"; "cmake ../" (go into the 'build' map and run cmake referring to root directory)   
3 "make" (execute the makefile)

the miniRT executable has been created! It wont work without an input file.rt though.

we included some pre-defined configurations, to run these:\
"./miniRT ../sample-configs/b_day_boy.rt"\
"./miniRT ../sample-configs/many_pillars.rt"\
"./miniRT ../sample-configs/sortofmolecule.rt"
